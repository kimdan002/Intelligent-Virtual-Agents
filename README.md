The RPI Admissions Chatbot is designed to provide answers and guidance to prospective students about admissions processes, programs, scholarships, campus life, and other important details at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The bot leverages the AIML framework and uses contextual response techniques like <srai>, <that>, <set>, <get>, and <condition> to create an engaging and dynamic interaction.
