Bot: rpiadmissions

Features:
1. Admissions Guidance: Answers questions about admissions deadlines, application processes, and early decision plans to help students plan effectively.
2 Campus Insights: Provides details about campus life, housing options, and the variety of student activities available at RPI.
3. Programs and Scholarships: Shares information about programs offered at RPI and scholarships, including prestigious awards like the Rensselaer Medal.
4. Interactive and Personalized: The bot remembers user preferences, such as their name or favorite subject, and uses this information to tailor its responses. It also asks follow-up questions to keep the conversation flowing.
5. Links to Resources: Directs users to official RPI pages for further details, ensuring accuracy and convenience.

Design of the Dialogue Management System:
1. Centralized Information: Common queries, such as those about admissions deadlines or help commands, are managed in dedicated sections to ensure clarity.
When similar questions arise, the chatbot redirects users to the appropriate answers to avoid redundancy.
2. Dynamic Context Handling: The bot tracks user inputs, such as their name or the context of the conversation, to provide relevant and personalized replies.
For example, it remembers the user's name and includes it in future responses. It also recognizes the context of the previous message to handle follow-ups effectively.
3. Fallback Mechanism: If the user asks a question the bot doesn’t understand, it responds with a helpful message encouraging them to ask about admissions, campus life, or RPI programs.
4. Engaging Conversations:The chatbot provides varied and engaging responses for certain questions, like “Why should I choose RPI?” This makes the conversation feel natural and interactive.
